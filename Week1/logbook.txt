problem 1

initial thoughts:
store where the leaves in a vector
store where the worm will rest in a vector
compare the positions of each vector

attempt:
looks ugly, must be an easier way.

more thoughts:
one for loop, check if the mod of leaf and rest are 0. if both equal to zero, increment res.

attempt:
it works.

reflection:
don't store things unnecessarily
