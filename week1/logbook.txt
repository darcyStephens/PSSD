problem 1 Inchworm

initial thoughts:
store where the leaves in a vector
store where the worm will rest in a vector
compare the positions of each vector

attempt:
looks ugly, must be an easier way.

more thoughts:
one for loop, check if the mod of leaf and rest are 0. if both equal to zero, increment res.

attempt:
it works.

reflection:
don't store things unnecessarily

problem 2 ThrowTheBall

initial thoughts:
draw out an example of it, can't make sense of it.
need to track the number of times eahc player has held the ball.
stepping through the example, once all players have passed the ball around, the ball travels in the reverse order.
for the first example where
N = 5
M = 3
L = 2
the ball goes, 
1,4,2,5,3 then goes 3,5,2,4,1

plan:
simulate one round of passing and multiply the number of passes by M - 1.
so the above example will be 5 * 2 = 10

how to simulate a round:
getting stuck here.
